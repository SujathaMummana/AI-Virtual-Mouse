# AI-Virtual-Mouse
AI Virtual Mouse uses computer vision and machine learning to control the mouse through hand gestures. It utilizes Mediapipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing. The project allows real-time mouse movement, clicks, and scrolling, providing an accessible, hands-free alternative to traditional mouse control.
